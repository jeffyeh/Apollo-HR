Apollo automatic tool

## Description  
  
This project is an automated clock-in and clock-out script based on Playwright, designed to simplify the daily process of clocking in and out for work. The script automatically logs into the specified clocking website and performs the clock-in or clock-out operation at a randomly chosen time within the specified time range. The script also intelligently skips clocking on weekends and public holidays.  
  
### Features  
  
- **Automated Login**: Users only need to configure the login information once, and the script will handle the login process automatically.  
- **Randomized Clocking Time**: The script selects a random time within the specified time range to perform the clocking operation, simulating a realistic clocking behavior.  
- **Public Holiday and Weekend Check**: The script checks whether the current day is a public holiday or a weekend and automatically skips clocking on these days.  
- **Configurable Clocking Time Range**: Users can modify the clocking time range according to their needs.  
  
### Use Cases  
  
This script is ideal for work situations where clocking in and out at fixed times is required, especially in cases where manual login to a clocking website and button clicking are needed. By automating these repetitive tasks, it saves time and reduces the risk of errors.  
  
### Ease of Use  
  
- **Easy Installation**: Install the dependencies and run the script to use it.  
- **Easy Configuration**: Only a few configuration changes are needed to customize the script according to personal requirements.  
- **Extensibility**: The script can be extended and modified to fit different clocking systems as needed.  
  
In summary, this automated clock-in and clock-out script is an efficient, flexible, and user-friendly solution suitable for work environments that require regular clocking.
